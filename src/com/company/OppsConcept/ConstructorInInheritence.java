ðŸ“š Learning and Concepts: Constructor in Inheritance

ðŸ”¹ What happens during constructor chaining in inheritance?

When an object of a derived class is created:
	â€¢	The base class constructor is called first.
	â€¢	Then the derived class constructor is called.
	â€¢	Then any further subclass constructors (like child of derived) are executed.

This is called constructor chaining, and it flows from top to bottom.

ðŸ”¹ Rules of Constructor Execution:
	1.	Java always calls the constructor of the parent class first before executing the childâ€™s constructor.
	2.	You can use super() to call a specific constructor of the parent class.
	3.	If no constructor is defined, Java adds a default constructor implicitly.
	4.	If a parameterized constructor is defined and not handled, it will throw a compile-time error if super() is not explicitly used.
