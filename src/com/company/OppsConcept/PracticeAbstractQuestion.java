/*
Concept
Explanation
Abstract Class
Pen is abstract and provides method contracts that FountainPen must implement.
Inheritance
FountainPen inherits from Pen, Human inherits from Monkey.
Interfaces
BasicAnimal defines abstract behaviors (eat() and sleep()), implemented by Human.
Polymorphism
Using parent class/interface reference (Monkey, BasicAnimal) to point to a child class (Human) object.
Method Overriding
Human overrides methods of BasicAnimal and uses inherited methods from Monkey.


	‚Ä¢	Pen is like a blueprint. You can‚Äôt use it directly. But you can create a real pen like FountainPen by implementing how it writes and how it refills.
	‚Ä¢	Monkey is like a base animal class; Human is a special monkey that can speak and also do basic animal activities like eat and sleep.
	‚Ä¢	Using polymorphism is like seeing someone as just a ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù or just a ‚Äúbasic animal‚Äù, even if that someone is a human. So, their abilities are limited to what‚Äôs defined in the reference type.

	‚úÖ Key Takeaways
	‚Ä¢	Use abstract classes when you want to force subclasses to provide implementations.
	‚Ä¢	Use interfaces to define capabilities (like eat/sleep) that can be added to any class.
	‚Ä¢	Polymorphism helps in writing flexible, loosely-coupled code.
