‚ú® Summary & Key Points:
------------------------------

‚úÖ Method Overriding:
   - When a child class provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.
   - Must have the **same method name, return type, and parameters**.

‚úÖ @Override Annotation:
   - Helps to ensure you are actually overriding a method.
   - Gives a compile-time error if the method is not correctly overridden.

‚úÖ Polymorphism in action:
   - Even though the method is defined in both parent and child,
     the method in the child class gets called when using a child class object.

‚ùó Note:
   - This is **Method Overriding**, NOT Method Overloading.
   - Method Overloading = Same method name with different parameters (in same class).

üìå Real-life Use Case:
   - Used when you want to define specific behavior in subclass while still inheriting from a base class.
