/* ðŸ“š Summary: Inheritance in Java

ðŸ”¹ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent).

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:
	â€¢	extends keyword is used to inherit from a class.
	â€¢	Parent class = Superclass
	â€¢	Child class = Subclass
	â€¢	Reusability of code is a major benefit.
	â€¢	Child class can access public and protected members of the parent.
	â€¢	Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes (only with interfaces).

ðŸ”¹ Syntax Example: class Animal {
    void sound() { }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { }
}

ðŸ”¹ Notes:
	â€¢	Constructors are not inherited, but can be called using super().
	â€¢	Always use access modifiers like private and public properly to encapsulate data.
