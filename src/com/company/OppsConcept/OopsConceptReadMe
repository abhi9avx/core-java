Object orientede tries to map code instruction with the real world making the code short and easier to understand

what is oops
Solving a problem by creating a object is one of the the most popular approch in proggramming language , this is called as OOPS


what is DRY?
DRY stand for Do nt repeat yourself (focus on code reusebility)

class -> A class s a blue print of creating object
example - >
class (Contain info to create a valid object)  -> object instantiation -> object
jee application form -> filled by student -> application for that student

object -> object is a instantiation of a clas , when a class is defined a templates (info) is defied  , memory is allocated only afer the object instantiation


hoe to model a problem in oops ?
WE IDENTIFY TEH FOLLLWING
Noun -> class -> Employee
Adjective -> Attributes(PROPERTIES)  -> name , age , salary
Verb -> METHOD -> GETsLARY() , INCREAMENT ()

🌍 What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities as objects in code.
It makes code easier to manage, reuse, and understand by closely mapping code instructions to real-world things.

⸻

🧠 Why Use OOP?
	•	✅ Helps in writing modular and maintainable code
	•	✅ Follows the DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
	•	✅ Encourages code reusability using objects and classes
	•	✅ Makes problem-solving more intuitive by thinking in terms of real-world objects

⸻

🧱 What is a Class?

A class is like a blueprint or template to create objects.
It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) of an object.

📦 Example:

class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;

    void getSalary() {
        // logic to return salary
    }

    void increment() {
        // logic to increase salary
    }
}


⸻

👤 What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class.
Memory is allocated only when an object is created, not when the class is defined.

📄 Think of:
	•	🧾 Class: JEE Application Form Template
	•	🧍 Object: A form filled and submitted by a student
Each student → One object based on the same class.

⸻

🔁 What is DRY in OOP?

DRY = Don’t Repeat Yourself

Instead of repeating logic, OOP promotes code reuse through:
	•	Inheritance
	•	Functions (methods)
	•	Class reuse

⸻

🛠️ How to Model a Problem Using OOP?

To convert a real-world problem into code using OOP:

Real World Part	OOP Mapping	Example
Noun	Class	Employee
Adjective	Attributes / Properties	name, age, salary
Verb	Methods / Functions	getSalary(), increment()

This method of thinking helps you break down problems into manageable code units.

🌐 OOPs Kya Hota Hai?

OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) ek aisa programming style hai jisme real world cheezon ko code mein object ke form mein represent kiya jata hai.

🧠 Object-oriented approach ka main focus hota hai:
	•	Code ko real-world jaisa banana
	•	Code ko short, readable, aur manageable banana

⸻

🔁 DRY Principle Kya Hai?

DRY ka full form hai – Don’t Repeat Yourself.
Matlab: ek hi logic baar-baar likhne ke bajaye reuse karna chahiye, jaise methods, functions, classes ke through.

⸻

🏗️ Class Kya Hoti Hai?

Class ek template (ya blueprint) hota hai jisse object banaya jata hai.
Ye batata hai ki ek object ke kya properties (attributes) aur kya actions (methods) honge.

📄 Example:
Socho JEE application form – ye ek class hai.
Jab koi student form bharta hai, to ek specific object ban jaata hai us student ke liye.

class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;

    void getSalary() {
        // salary return karne ka logic
    }

    void increment() {
        // salary badhane ka logic
    }
}


⸻

👤 Object Kya Hota Hai?

Object class ka ek instance (copy) hota hai.
Jab tak object create nahi hota, tab tak memory allocate nahi hoti.
Jab hum class se object banate hain, tabhi wo real data ke saath kaam karta hai.

🧍 Example:
	•	Employee e1 = new Employee(); → yeh e1 ek object hai jo Employee class ka bana hai.

⸻

🧠 OOPs Mein Problem Ko Kaise Model Karein?

Real-world problem ko object-oriented way mein model karne ke liye hum 3 cheezein identify karte hain:

Real World	Code Mapping	Example
Noun	Class	Employee
Adjective	Attributes/Properties	name, age, salary
Verb	Method/Action	getSalary(), increment()


⸻

✅ OOPs Kya Laata Hai?
	•	Code zyada clean aur organized hota hai
	•	Reuse kar sakte ho bina same cheez baar-baar likhe
	•	Real world problems ko model karna easy ho jata hai

🔑 OOPS Terminology

1. Abstraction

→ Hiding the internal details [ Show only essential info ]
Real Example: Use this phone without bothering about how it was made.

⸻

2. Encapsulation

→ The act of putting various components together (in a capsule)
Example: Laptop is a single entity with WiFi + Speaker + Storage in a single box!
In Java, encapsulation simply means that the sensitive data can be hidden from the users.

⸻

3. Inheritance

→ The act of deriving new things from existing things
Examples:
Rickshaw → E-Rickshaw
Phone → SmartPhone
Implement DRY!

⸻

4. Polymorphism

→ One entity, many forms
Examples:
SmartPhone → Phone
SmartPhone → Calculator
SmartPhone → Camera
