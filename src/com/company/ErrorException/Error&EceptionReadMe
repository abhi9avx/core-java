Error & Exception

No matter how smart we are, errors are our constant companions.
With practice, we get better at finding, fixing, and understanding them.

⸻

Three Types of Errors in Java:
	1.	Syntax Error
	2.	Logical Error
	3.	Run-Time Error → Also called Exception

⸻

1. Syntax Error (Faced by Programmer)

These errors occur when the compiler finds something wrong with the structure of the code.
It prevents the program from compiling.

Examples:

int a = 9    // → Missing semicolon
a = a+;      // → Incomplete expression
d = 5;       // → Variable 'd' not declared

These are caught at compile-time and are usually easy to fix.

2. Logical Error (Faced by Programmer)

A logical error or bug happens when the program compiles and runs but does not behave as expected.

Examples:
	1.	Message delivered to the wrong user
	2.	Chat time displayed incorrectly
	3.	Wrong page redirection
	4.	Incorrect calculations or outputs

These are harder to detect as the program runs without crashing but gives unexpected results.

3. Run-Time Error (Faced by User) — ⭐ Important

These occur while the program is running. In Java, they are called Exceptions.

Examples:
	1.	Bad Input (e.g., dividing by zero, invalid user input)
	2.	Resource Constraints (e.g., memory not available, file not found)
	3.	Network failure or DB connection timeout
	4.	Array Index Out of Bound
	5.	Null Pointer Exception

Java provides a strong Exception Handling mechanism to deal with these issues using:
	•	try & catch blocks
	•	throw, throws, and finally keywords

These help in preventing application crashes and allow developers to handle errors gracefully.

📌 What is an Exception in Java?

An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

🔄 Types of Exceptions in Java

There are mainly two types of exceptions:
	1.	Checked Exception
👉 Also called Compile-Time Exception
👉 These are checked by the compiler
👉 Must be handled using try-catch or declared with throws
	2.	Unchecked Exception
👉 Also called Run-Time Exception
👉 Occur during program execution
👉 Not checked at compile time — handled only if needed

⸻

⚠️ Commonly Occurring Exceptions
	1.	NullPointerException
→ Accessing methods or variables on a null object
	2.	ArithmeticException
→ Dividing a number by zero (e.g., 100 / 0)
	3.	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
→ Trying to access an array index that doesn’t exist
	4.	IllegalArgumentException
→ Passing an illegal or inappropriate argument to a method
	5.	NumberFormatException
→ Trying to convert an invalid string to a number
→ Example: Integer.parseInt("abc")
