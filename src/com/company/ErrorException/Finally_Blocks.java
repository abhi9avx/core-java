/*
for cleaning up the resource we have to use finally , even if we use the break ,
üß† What is finally in Java?
	‚Ä¢	The finally block is used for cleanup code like closing files, releasing memory, or logging information.
	‚Ä¢	It always executes, even if:
	‚Ä¢	An exception is thrown
	‚Ä¢	A return statement is hit
	‚Ä¢	A break or continue is used inside a loop

‚∏ª

üìå Key Takeaways:
	‚Ä¢	Best Practice: Use finally to clean up resources such as:
	‚Ä¢	File streams
	‚Ä¢	Network sockets
	‚Ä¢	Database connections
	‚Ä¢	Even if your program crashes, finally will execute.
