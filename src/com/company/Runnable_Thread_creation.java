/*

ðŸ§  Explanation (Line by Line)
	â€¢	implements Runnable â†’ Allows your class to define a task that can run in a thread.
	â€¢	Thread gun1 = new Thread(bullet1); â†’ You wrap your task (bullet1) in a Thread object to execute it concurrently.
	â€¢	gun1.start(); â†’ Starts the thread, which internally calls run() of your Runnable class.

âœ… Key Points:
	â€¢	Runnable is best when your class already extends another class.
	â€¢	Thread t = new Thread(Runnable r) â†’ a common pattern in real-world applications.
	â€¢	Always call start() to run the thread concurrently â€” never call run() directly unless testing.
