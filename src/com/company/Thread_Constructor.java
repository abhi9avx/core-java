/*

âœ… Why Use Thread Constructor?
	â€¢	Helps identify threads easily during debugging or logging.
	â€¢	Useful in applications with multiple threads doing different tasks.
	â€¢	Clean separation of thread identity from the task (run()).

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Use Case

Imagine a banking app:
	â€¢	Thread "TransactionProcessor"
	â€¢	Thread "NotificationSender"
	â€¢	Naming threads helps in debugging when you have logs from different parts of your system.
