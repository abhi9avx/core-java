üîñ Annotations in Java (Explained Clearly)

Annotations in Java are used to provide extra information (metadata) about a program to the compiler and runtime. They do not directly affect program logic but help in tasks like code analysis, compilation checks, and runtime processing.

Here are some of the commonly used built-in annotations:
	1.	@Override
	‚Ä¢	Indicates that a method is being overridden from a superclass.
	‚Ä¢	Helps the compiler catch errors if the method signature doesn‚Äôt match the parent class method.
	2.	@SuppressWarnings
	‚Ä¢	Tells the compiler to ignore specific warnings (like unchecked type warnings or deprecation notices).
	‚Ä¢	Useful to clean up compiler output while still writing safe and controlled code.
	3.	@Deprecated
	‚Ä¢	Marks a method or class as deprecated, meaning it‚Äôs no longer recommended for use.
	‚Ä¢	The compiler will show a warning if the deprecated element is used elsewhere in the code.

‚∏ª
üîç What‚Äôs Happening Here:
	‚Ä¢	@Override: Used in NewPhone class to override call() method from the Phone class.
	‚Ä¢	@Deprecated: Marks oldRingTone() as outdated, signaling it‚Äôs not recommended for use.
	‚Ä¢	@SuppressWarnings("deprecation"): Hides the warning generated when calling a deprecated method in main().
