ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Need Collections?

We need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in Java.

For example, we use an array to store integers, but what if we want to:
	â€¢	Resize the array
	â€¢	Insert an element in between
	â€¢	Delete an element from the array
	â€¢	Apply operations to modify this array?

In such cases, arrays become limited, and collections provide better solutions.

ðŸ”¹ How Are Collections Available?

Collections in Java are available as classes and interfaces under the java.util package.

Here are some commonly used collections in Java:
	â€¢	ArrayList â†’ For variable-size collections
	â€¢	Set â†’ For distinct elements (no duplicates)
	â€¢	Stack â†’ A LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure
	â€¢	HashMap â†’ For storing key-value pairs

Collection class is available in java.util package.
collection class also provides static method for sorting and searching.

ðŸ“Œ Quick Tip:

To use any collection, just import:
